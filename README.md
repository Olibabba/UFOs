# UFOs

### Overview
A newspaper doing research on UFO sightings has commisioned me to make a 
web site to assist with searching through a UFO sighting database.

My goal is to present the database and allow the user to filter based on any of the basic criteria. 

The website can be viewed here: https://olibabba.github.io/UFOs/

### Results

The search/filter process should be pretty intuitive. After you type your entry, press enter and the table will update. 

There are some peculiarties to pay attention to however.

There are 5 filters available for the follwing data points:
- date 
- city 
- state 
- country 
- shape

The filters are reductive, so each filter you add will reduce your reults further. If the table comes up blank, then there are no matches for your entry.

In order to broaden your search and get more results, you must and delete or clear filters one by one.

![Two Filters](https://github.com/Olibabba/UFOs/blob/main/resources/two_filters.png)

The filters do not require you to complete the entire word. So you can searh for cities that start with "Fr" and return Freson, Francis Creek, and Freedom.

![Partial Filter](https://github.com/Olibabba/UFOs/blob/main/resources/Partial_search.png)

It is not a smart filter. So misspellings will not return anything.

### Summary

While this is a great start, I would say a major draw back is that the only way to clear the filters is to delete then one by one. 

An idea for future development would be to add a "Clear Filters" button.

I would also recommend making the comments searchable/filterable. If we could search for a date of 1/1/2010 and "red" in the comments, we would quickly see that many of the reports are of the same three red lights on New Years Eve.
